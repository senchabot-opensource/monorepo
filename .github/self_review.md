## Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Confirm the changes you made adheres to [contribution guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] Please be sure you've created a new branch in your fork for this PR.
- [ ] Pull Request should be related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.
- [ ] Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and syntax errors.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.
